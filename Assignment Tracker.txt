Finished first two excercises.

Must do the following things:
	-DO NOT need to test the first excercise further as it is trivial and will work for any case.
	
	-HOWEVER, the second excercise needs further testing. Although the code made on first attempt 
	 in theory will work for any data set, as it considers the size of the pattern data set and the data 
	 series and it does what is intended to do, it could be further optimised (probably not bc i just
	 tried the while loop barrier and you still need the same amount of code, also my code is clear in its
	 current form but i will see about that.).
	
	-Consider the following for the first two tasks:
		-Use of meaningful variable names where applicable.
		-Use of sensible comments to explain what you're doing.
		-Use of docstring for documentation to identify purpose, author, date , data dictionary, 
		 parameters, return value(s) and program description at the top of the file.

Once these tasks are finished, then complete the other two.

Completely finished the first two excercises as done with the conditions from the previous log.

Updated the first two tasks with all the requirements stated in the previous task, although I did not choose to optimise the current code for the second
task as finding out now that you have access to someone else's previous assignment, the code is well optimised. Although they did find a mathematical
expression to find the final integer limit for the range of values, I just used a loop-break which is somewhat simpler, and only adds one extra line of 
code soooooooo, yeah whatever.

Next thing to do is to find out task 3 and 4, do these up to standard of the conditions for previous tasks, and we can see what happens from there.

Completely finished the first three tasks.

Edited the first two tasks 'info' section, finished the third task to completion.

The third task can be coded in many ways, however the shortest obtainable solution was achieved, BUT it isn't adequately tested. Although
reading finalised code should be applicable in all cases in theory, it would be better if it was fully tested. Re-learning the randint()
and generating a list with a purposely inputted pattern inside, should be able to do the trick.

To complete task 4, refer to the draft files for task 3, as they provide an insight into how to find the many acceptable similarity peaks.

yeah, complete task 4, then for the rest of the assignment period, test, test, test!

Completed main code for all tasks.

Need to further optimise task 4 and add comments.
