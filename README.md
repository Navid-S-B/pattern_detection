# Pattern Detection
This is my first ever python project before i switched to a SWE degree in 2019.

This university assignment specifies rules for recognising data patterns, based on a simalarity index. The pattern recognition code builds upon this index,
to create better and better pattern recognition in more complex data input cases.

All test files were initially built by the course convener, and with their permission we were able to build our own test cases on top of theirs.

This assignment recieved a 100 mark.

Refer to the assignment spec for more information.
